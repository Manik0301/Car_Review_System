## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.
i developed a simple Java project using the JavaFX framework for the user interface and Oracle 21c for database management. The project focused on creating an interactive and user-friendly application with features such as data input, retrieval, and basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. JavaFX provided a dynamic and responsive UI, while Oracle 21c ensured efficient data storage and management. The project demonstrated seamless database connectivity using JDBC, enabling smooth interaction between the front-end and back-end. It served as a practical implementation of UI development and database integration using modern Java technologies.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
